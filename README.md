Welcome to SL Magic, where i try to play around with SL APIs and see if i can find a way to save some money and survive the cold!

**Why Create this mess?**

I want to from Arlanda which happens to be the airport in Stockholm to my home without waiting too long at night.

**Why I want to do this?**
*  Avoid paying exorbitant taxi fares
* To Avoid freezing to death in Cold winters!

**How do I think I can do this?**
* Run the API and find connection times
* Maybe see if we can have go a stop before or after my usual stop and then come back. 
* Find an alternate with lowest wait time and also reasonable travel time. 
    * Not too much of a travel.
	* This needs to be clarified.

**What do i hope to give?**
* An idea on how you can create your own tool to brave harsh winters.
